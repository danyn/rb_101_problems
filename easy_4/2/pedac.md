# Problem
Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.

# Example

century(2000) == '20th'
century(2001) == '21st'
century(1965) == '20th'
century(256) == '3rd'
century(5) == '1st'
century(10103) == '102nd'
century(1052) == '11th'
century(1127) == '12th'
century(11201) == '113th'

# Data

year -> int
century -> str

# Algorithm

year / 100 -> the base year
if year % 100 > 0
then the century is the base year + 1:
base + 1
