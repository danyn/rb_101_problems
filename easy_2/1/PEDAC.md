## Problem
Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age.
To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.
-> print a random number between 20 and 200


## Example (test)
Teddy is 69 years old!
## Data
 
## Algorithm

create a raondom number that goes from 0 to 180
then add 20 so it goes from 20 to 180
test by iterating the function 1000 times and see if it ever goes out of bounds

## GENERALIZED

max - min = offset
range = rand(offset)
range + min -> return
